# expressjs
This project is a basic Express.js server that implements two primary APIs: a GET API that returns both query and path parameters, and a POST API that accepts JSON data and returns an array of processed data. This server serves as a practical example of how to set up an Express application, handle various HTTP requests, and respond with JSON data.
